     <p class="text-box"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boil the Pasta.Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat until it is al dente (firm to the bite).<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Sauté the aromatics. While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil and butter in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the diced shallot or onion and cook for 3–5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant. <br>    
    <strong>Step 3:</strong>Toast the tomato paste and deglaze with vodka.  Stir the tomato paste into the shallot and garlic mixture. Cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly. This step caramelizes the paste, deepens the flavor, and removes any metallic taste. Pour in the vodka and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Let it simmer and reduce for 1–2 minutes to burn off the alcohol.<br>
   <strong>Step 4:</strong>Finish the sauce. Turn the heat down to low. Slowly pour in the heavy cream and stir until the sauce is smooth and pink. Stir in the Parmesan cheese until it is melted and fully incorporated. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste.<br>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong>Combine and serve. Add the drained, cooked pasta directly into the sauce in the skillet. Pour in a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss everything together over medium heat for 1–2 minutes, allowing the sauce to cling to the pasta. Add more pasta water as needed, one tablespoon at a time, to reach your desired consistency. Remove from the heat and serve immediately. Garnish each bowl with fresh basil and extra grated Parmesan cheese. <br>
   
 <h2 id="Fredo">Alfredo Pasta</h2>

<h3 class="text-box">Fun Alfredo pasta Facts: Alfredo pasta was invented in Rome around 1908 by Alfredo di Lelio for his wife, Ines, to stimulate her appetite after childbirth. The original dish was a simple, creamy blend of butter, Parmesan cheese, and fettuccine, but the American version often includes heavy cream, multiple cheeses, and other ingredients like chicken or shrimp. </h3>

    <p class="text-box"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boil the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook according to package directions until al dente.<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong>Reserve pasta water. Before draining, save about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water. This is a crucial ingredient for adjusting the sauce's consistency.<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> the sauce. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. If using garlic, add it to the skillet and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute). Pour in the heavy cream and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, whisking frequently. Do not let the sauce boil rapidly.<br>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> the cheese. Reduce the heat to low and gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until it is completely melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and black pepper.<br>
<strong>Step 5:</strong> Combine the pasta and sauce. Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the sauce and toss gently to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.<br>
<strong>Step 6:</strong>Serve immediately. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.<br>
